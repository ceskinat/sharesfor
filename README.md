sharesfor is an open source messaging and collaboration platform, that features simple integration capabilities with your existing applications. 
sharesfor can relate to objects in your existing application and provide message threads related to that object -and others that may be co-related- thereby sharing and collecting information on it.
For example, objects can be the accounts, contacts, projects, etc. in your CRM; the courses, lectures, subjects, classes, etc. on your Learning Management Sytem;  or any other item in any of your applications.
sharesfor provides a familiar real time messaging interface so that users provide personal/corporate memory on those objects by creating and populating message threads
sharesfor is activated through a POST request with the following parameters:
{userid, username, email, otype, oid}
which corresponds to user information (userid, username, email) and object information (otype: object type; oid: object id). 
See integration.md for integrating your application with sharesfor and installation.md for sharesfor installation instructions.
